## Census Income Prediction

### Introduction

- US Adult Census data relating income to social factors such as Age, Education, race etc.
The Us Adult income dataset was extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 US Census
Database. The data set consists of anonymous information such as occupation, age, native
country, race, capital gain, capital loss, education, work class and more. Each row is labelled
as either having a salary greater than ">50K" or "<=50K".

- This Data set is in dataset.csv The goal here is to train a binary classifier on the training
dataset to predict the column income_bracket which has two possible values ">50K" and
"<=50K" and evaluate the accuracy of the classifier with the test dataset.
